Click [Popcorn_recommendation-Engine](https://popcorn-movie-recommender.herokuapp.com/), to checkout my website and engine.

The website is being hosted at Heroku. Welcome to PopCorn Recommendation Engine. 
We are here to Recommend you the best movies. We have used both Content-Bases Filtering and Collaborative-Bases Filtering for our engine.
It also uses a searching algorithm which effectively guide you to find the perfect movie for you. It is a multi feature application that allows the user to 

--> Search and get recommendation by a particular movie/according to other user interests. 

--> Search and get recommendation by year 

--> create a self curated bucket-list for specific future interests and will also show you movies similar to that movie. 

--> Rate movies and get to know the ratings of other users and movies in order to decide their preferences 

--> Login/Signup to save app data 

--> Change theme of the website according to one's preference and comfort. 

The Dataset used is a subset of TMDb movies-dataset as well as Imdb Dataset. The datasets, being larger files, have been uploaded on a drive of which the link has been attached. 

And similarity.pkl file which stores the vectorization and similarity points for movies, has also been uploaded on the drive of which the link has been attached.
