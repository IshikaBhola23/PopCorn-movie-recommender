# PopCorn-Movie Recommendation Engine

This is a web application showcasing a recommendation engine based on user's choice and inputs in [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).
It is a multi feature application that allows the user to -
-> Search and get recommendation by year
-> create a self curated bucket-list for specific future interests
-> Rate movies and get to know the ratings of other users in order to decide their preferences
-> Login/Signup to save app data
-> Change theme of the website according to one's preference and comfort
See the app live [here](https://popcorn-movie-recommender.herokuapp.com/). For more info, check out our [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/main_concepts.html#themes) and [blog post](https://blog.streamlit.io/introducing-theming/).
